# findDuplicateImages

This program searches for duplicate images efficiently.

## Dependencies:
    Python3
    numpy
    OpenCV
    shutil


## How to use:
1. Place this script in the directory containing all your photos OR
    put the script anywhere and edit the line,
    
    `directory = ""`
    
    to look like,
    
    `directory = "path/to/your/directory"`
    
2. Create a directory there called "Duplicates"
3. Run the script with "python findDuplicateImages.py" Output will be produced showing you exactly what the program is doing. None of your files will be lost or altered, they will only be moved to the "Duplicates" directory. You can choose to delete this directory after running the script.
